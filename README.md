Ghetto-Bros
===========

Parody sidescrolling platformer-shooter game.

Notes
-----

This game does not seem to run on Windows 7 64-bit.

I wrote this in 2004/2005 on Windows XP 32-bit. I do not believe this game will run on 64-bit systems. It seems to function acceptably so on my 32-bit Wine setup on Gentoo (with Win dependencies installed such as .NET, directx)
